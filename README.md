# CVMayker
- CVMayker is a django app which job-seekers can make their CVs and send them to HRs.
- HRs are also capable to check the received CVs in their panel.

## Installation guide, step by step:

* First of all, clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/EngRobot33/CVMayker.git
```
* Then, we need a virtual environment. You can create like this:
```
virtualenv venv
```
* Activate it with the command below:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
* After that, you must install all of the packages in `requirements.txt` file in project directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Then, you should create a `.env` file in root directory for adding your configs:
```
DEBUG = 'Project debug status'
SECRET_KEY = 'Your Secret Key generated by https://djecrety.ir'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ''
```
* Now, you should have a superuser for accessing to admin panel:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
* After that, migration:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
* That's finished now you can run the project:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
